Sick heelies for the homie


# Config

(run once to create the config file)

As of *0.2.0*:
***heeliesButton*** (default "Space"): button for using your new kicks. Comma-separate for multiple bindings, like "Space, RightTrigger"
 For possible please refer to [this page](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Key_Bindings#Button_codes) from the Stardew Valley Wiki detailing the button codes.

***initialSpeedBoost*** (default 3.5): how hard you kick off. I like 3.5 cause it doesn't feel like a HUGE boost, but you can go nuts. I like 4 as well but maybe you're braver
