# Config

(run once to create the config file)

As of *0.2.0*:
***heeliesButton*** (default "Space"): button for using your new kicks. Comma-separate for multiple bindings, like "Space, RightTrigger"
 For possible values see below enumeration tables:
- [controller button names](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/xna/bb975202(v=xnagamestudio.40))
 [keyboard key names](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/xna/bb197781(v=xnagamestudio.10))

***initialSpeedBoost*** (default 3.5): how hard you kick off. I like 3.5 cause it doesn't feel like a HUGE boost, but you can go nuts. I like 4 as well but maybe you're braver
